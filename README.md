# opencv-drawing-in-air-upgraded
This is an upgrade of a previous OpenCV project that allows you to draw in the air. Just download the code and run it on your computer - it's really simple to use.

Here are the basic controls:
- `c` to change colors
- `e` to erase
- `g` to create a gap
- `esc` to exit

Thank you for your support!
